-- Rolls back db/upgrade-14-appointments.sql: back to one row per post. The HISTORY IS LOST: ended appointments and

-- back. Who holds each post now stays. Use it only with the API/NexusCore packages from before this change.
-- Does nothing when upgrade-14 is not applied. Back up the database first.
